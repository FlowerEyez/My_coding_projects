# My Coding Projects

This is a collection of personal projects I've worked on for a while, nothing special.

---

## About
Each Folder contains a different project type and is named accordingly
(Python, Rust, Websites, etc.)
---

## Installation
most can be just downloaded and run directly, if packages are required there should be a requirements.txt.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/FlowerEyez/My_coding_projects
cd My_coding_projects
# For Python projects, install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt #(if applicable)#
